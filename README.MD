## Overview

This project is a web application built with Angular and .NET Core, designed for managing quotes and books. The frontend is developed using Angular, leveraging modules, components, and services to provide a user-friendly interface. The backend, built with .NET Core, includes an API that handles CRUD operations for quotes and books, supported by JWT authentication for secure access. The application integrates a PostgreSQL database to store data persistently. Additionally, it uses YARP for reverse proxy configuration to route requests appropriately between the frontend and backend. I used both swedish and english languages for this app.

### Database
The project uses the relational database PostgreSQL to store the data. I used PostgreSQL because it is considered one of the recommended databases on the Heroku platform.

## Features

### Existing Features

__Header__

- The header has an adaptive navigation bar on the right. There are three links: books, quotes, login/logout. The visitor can easily navigate through these links thanks to the responsive bar. Also, in the mobile or medium screen extension version, there will be a “hamburger” icon on the right side of the adaptive panel, which means that the same links are hidden behind it. This is very convenient and allows you to take up less page space.
